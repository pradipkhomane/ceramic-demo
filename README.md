## Overview

Ceramic is a decentralized data network that enables the creation of composable Web3 applications. By decentralizing application databases, Ceramic empowers developers to reuse data across applications and ensure automatic interoperability.

This project aims to explore the functionality of Ceramic Self.ID by creating sovereign user profiles. We'll delve into the importance of decentralized data and demonstrate how Ceramic facilitates the creation of data-rich, interoperable applications.

## Web3 and Data

The rise of Web3 trends like DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs underscores the value of composable applications. Just as smart contract platforms like Ethereum allow dApps to be composed together, Ceramic brings the same level of composability to data on the internet. Whether it's profiles, social connections, blog posts, identities, or game assets, Ceramic enables interoperability across applications.

## Lack of Data in Web3

While the current Web3 market primarily consists of financial applications, there's a growing demand for data-rich applications. Decentralized social media, reputation platforms, and blogs are gaining traction, but existing solutions often lack interoperability. Ceramic aims to address this by promoting interoperable applications and ecosystems, thereby outcompeting siloed platforms.

## What Ceramic Does

Ceramic is building:

- A generalized data protocol
- Data modification restricted to the owner
- High volume data processing
- Global data availability and consistency
- Support for fast querying
- Interoperable data across applications
- Community governance

To achieve its vision, Ceramic must scale massively, ensure global data availability, provide fast querying capabilities, and maintain security and privacy.

## Ceramic Use Cases

### Decentralized Reputation

Reputation is closely tied to identity and is currently siloed across platforms. Ceramic enables the creation of standardized, multi-chain reputation systems, allowing users to carry their reputation across different dApps and blockchains.

### Social Graphs

Traditional social graphs are centralized, limiting user autonomy and data ownership. Ceramic facilitates the creation of decentralized social graphs, allowing users to maintain their social connections across various platforms and dApps.

### Multi-Wallet and Multi-Chain Identity

By leveraging decentralized reputation systems, Ceramic enables multi-wallet and multi-chain identity solutions. Users can maintain a single source of truth for their data across different wallets and blockchains.

## Ceramic's Multi-Chain Architecture

At its core, Ceramic utilizes decentralized identities, such as 3IDs, to manage data ownership and modification. Each data stream on Ceramic is associated with a unique StreamID and can be modified by its owner(s) through commits.

## Using Ceramic

Ceramic provides a range of libraries and SDKs for different use cases:

- **Self.ID SDK:** High-level SDK for common use cases, abstracting complexities of 3IDs and Streams.
- **Ceramic HTTP Client:** Lower-level client for complex or customized use cases, offering direct interaction with Ceramic nodes.

## Build Instructions

We will create a simple Next.js application to demonstrate Ceramic Self.ID functionality. Users will be able to log in using their preferred wallet, create a decentralized profile, and store/retrieve data on the Ceramic Network.

### Setup

1. Create a new Next.js application:
    ```
    npx create-next-app@latest ceramic-tutorial
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install "@self.id/react" "@self.id/web" key-did-provider-ed25519 ethers@5 web3modal
    ```

### Implementation

1. Initialize Web3Modal and connect to Self.ID.
2. Implement a component to set and update user profile data on Ceramic.
3. Utilize hooks provided by Self.ID to manage connections and data streams.
4. Render UI components to interact with Ceramic.

For detailed implementation steps, refer to the provided code snippets and explanations.

## Conclusion

Ceramic Self.ID offers a powerful solution for building sovereign user profiles and data-rich applications in the Web3 ecosystem. By leveraging decentralized identities and interoperable data protocols, developers can create innovative, composable applications with enhanced user control and data ownership. Explore the provided code and documentation to unlock the full potential of Ceramic Self.ID in your projects.
